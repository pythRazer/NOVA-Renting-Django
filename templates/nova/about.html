    <h1>Overall purpose and intended audience</h1>
    <h4>An app can help international students rent homes and find roommates in Northern Virginia. It is difficult for international students to rent an apartment in the USA since most require a good credit score and social security number. The intended audience will be international students trying to rent a home or find roommates in Northern Virginia. This platform can help them find an apartment willing to have international students. To support truth and trust in an era of dis/misinformation, a verification and rating system is designed based on the feedback from tenants who lived there. A "Verified" badge will be next to content confirmed as "International students friendly and safe." The users can also interact and communicate with each other to discuss housing or finding roommates. In this way, students can avoid finding suspicious or unqualified apartments. The objective is to link international students with legitimate apartments that welcome them and prevent scams. The key "item" of the web app will be the housing profiles.</h4>
